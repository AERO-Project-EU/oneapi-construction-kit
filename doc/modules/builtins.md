The `builtins` directory provides implementations of builtin functions
for the heterogeneous APIs ComputeAorta implements. Originally developed for
OpenCL, but can be expanded further.

All builtins that implement math operations are provided by
[abacus](builtins/abacus), while all builtins implementing image
functionality are provided by [libimg](builtins/libimg).
