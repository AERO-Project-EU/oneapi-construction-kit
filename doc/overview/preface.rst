Preface
=======

This document provides an introduction to Codeplay's ComputeAorta product.  It
should help the reader understand how to use ComputeAorta to create a
high-performance implementation of open-standards for a processor or system,
i.e. SYCL, OpenCL, or Vulkan.  This implementation will enable programmers to
use a well-understood programming model, and allow all parties to benefit from
the open-standards software ecosystem.

This document will primarily be of interest to anyone considering such an
implementation. That could include a systems architect, a processor designer, a
compiler engineer, a language runtime engineer, a driver engineer, etc.  After
reading this document you should understand what ComputeAorta provides, how it
fits in with your existing hardware and software, and what requirements it
places on that hardware or software.
