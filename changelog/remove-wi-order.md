# Remove user-specifiable Work Item Order:

Upgrade guidance:
* The `-cl-wi-order` command-line option has been removed. Work item ordering
  can no longer be user-specified.

Feature additions:
* Work Item Ordering support has been removed from the front end. Kernel
  metadata/attributes and all supporting classes, structs and functions have
  also been deleted.
