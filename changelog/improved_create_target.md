Upgrade guidance:

* The `create_target.py` script and associated `json` files have been updated to support
  the "feature" element as a ';' separated list to show multiple end points for
  tutorials. This has been updated to show end points for `clmul` tutorial and to add
  lit test support for `refsi-wrapper-pass`. Also the need to escape some quotes in the
  `json` file is no longer needed.
