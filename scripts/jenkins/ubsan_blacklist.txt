# llvm::ilist_traits<Instruction>::createSentinel() uses an invalid downcast
# to create a sentinel that is then never accesses - therefore the ubsan error
# message does not really identify a problem:
# runtime error: downcast of address 0x7f2c869ac3d0 with insufficient space for
#                an object of type 'llvm::Instruction'
